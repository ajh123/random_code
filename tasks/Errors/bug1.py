#This program askes the user for 2 numbers as input
#Then we create a variable that stores the sum and one that stores 
#The difference between the bigger of the two numbers and the smaller one
#Finally we print the numbers with an appropriate message

b = input(Please insert second number)

s = a + B
d = min(a,b) - max(a,b)
