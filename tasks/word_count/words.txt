This is a regular sentence that contains words but not all words are the same of course as that would defeat the purpose of the task although some of the words must be the same otherwise we would not be able to get any relevant output also to simplify things a bit I avoided any punctuation as punctuation would require some degree of special consideration and that is outside the scope of the task but I would still like to see if you apply case insensitivity in this task
