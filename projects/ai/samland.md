Samland is a virtual micronation that has existed since 2017 and has a small online presence.

The Samland government can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/Samland-Gov/, or on the Miners Online Minecraft server, or on the official website https://samland.minersonline.uk/.

IMPORTANT!

Samland is not the Sambian Peninsula, a historical region located in the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia, however it is a common misconception.
